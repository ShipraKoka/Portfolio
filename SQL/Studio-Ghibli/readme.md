### Studio Ghibli Database and Reports

I was assigned to create and deploy a sample report using SQL Server Reporting Services. I created a database of Studio Ghibli movies, opened up SQL Server Business Intelligence Development Studio to add the data sets I wanted to use to create the reports, and then used Reporting Services Configuration Manager to deploy the reports.

For more detailed information on some of the challenges I faced while creating the reports and what steps I took to resolve those issues, please feel free to check out the Database and Reports folders, as well as the accompanying readme files.
